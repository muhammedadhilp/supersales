# Superstore-Sales-Dataset (SQL+Power BI) 

# Dataset Overview 
The Superstore dataset is a comprehensive collection of sales transactions for a fictional retail store, capturing detailed information across multiple dimensions of the business. Each record in the dataset represents an individual order and includes critical identifiers such as order_id and product_id to track transactions and products respectively. The dataset provides temporal details with columns like order_date, ship_date, and year, which enable time-series analysis and shipping performance evaluations.

Customer-related information is well-documented, featuring customer_name and segment, allowing for customer segmentation and behavior analysis. Geographic data is captured through state, country, market, and region, facilitating regional sales analysis and market trend identification.

Product details are granular, including category, sub_category, and product_name, supporting product performance assessments and inventory management. Financial metrics such as sales, quantity, discount, profit, and shipping_cost provide insights into revenue generation, cost management, and profitability analysis. Additionally, the ship_mode and order_priority columns offer further granularity on logistical and priority considerations of orders.

This dataset is valuable for conducting a wide range of data analyses, from basic descriptive statistics to advanced predictive modeling, making it an essential resource for data science and business analytics projects.
